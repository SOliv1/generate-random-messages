## Generate a random message in javascript

### It is written in the stars - Zodiac Messages
I enjoyed building this script. The idea for this mini project is to generate random messages using javascript.
The editor I used was vs-code with git version control pushing to github.
I use random numbers to generate random  letters namely the first vowels picked up by the generator to then create the random zodiac messages from the stars.  I have exciting ideas to expand this project so watch this space!
The command to execute this code:

* node starsign.js

If you think there are better ways to generate these messages, then please let me know. 
Feedback gratefully appreciated.   Thanks
