## Generate a random message in javascript

### It is written in the stars - Zodiac Messages
I enjoyed this mini portfolio project. 
The idea is to generate random messages using javascript.
The editor I used was vs-code with git version control pushing to github.
The project took me two days from conception to completion. 
First day planning and second day writing the code.  
I use random numbers to generate random letters, namely the *first* vowels picked up by the generator to create the random zodiac messages from the stars.  
I have exciting plans to expand this project so watch this space!
The command to execute this code is:

* node starsign.js

If you think there are better ways to generate these messages, then please let me know. 
Feedback gratefully appreciated.   Thanks
