#  Portfolio Project - Mixed Messages
## Generate random messages using javascript

### It is written in the stars - Zodiac Messages
I enjoyed this mini portfolio project. 
The idea is to generate random messages using javascript.
The editor I used was vs-code with git version control pushing to github.
The project took me two days from conception to completion. 
First day planning and second day writing the code.  
I create an array of mixed messages and to make my program truly random, the message outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. I think I achieved this.
I use random numbers to generate random letters, namely the *first* vowels picked up by the generator to create the random zodiac messages from the stars.  I especially enjoyed executing the command code on my terminal and generating lots of mixed messages writtern in the stars ... great fun.
The command to execute this code is:

* node starsign.js
* 
I have exciting plans to expand this project so watch this space!

If you think there are better ways to generate these messages, then please let me know. 
Feedback gratefully appreciated.   Thanks
